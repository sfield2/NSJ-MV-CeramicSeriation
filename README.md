# NSJ_MV_CeramicSeriation

This directory contains code written in R for:
1) Creating a seriation of Northern San Juan/Mesa Verde ceramics using correspondence analysis and calibration site data from the Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP) 
2) Using the seriation to determine occupation of sites based on sample/survey/excavation ceramic data using the Brainerd-Robinson coefficient of similarity (Peeples 2011)
3) Building an occupation curve (time series) for each site/structure

## Data
All data used for the seriation and example sample data from Mesa Verde National Park (Lancaster & other citations) are provided in folder entitled "DATA". 

## Analysis

Script used for analysis is an R script, entitled "ANALYSIS", that contains all necessary commands for building the seriation, applying it to sample data, and building a time series.
